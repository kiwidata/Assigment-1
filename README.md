## Overview of Project
Louis is looking for information related to the success of plays. When would be the best lauch date and which goal she should strive for.
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to provide Louis with information related to the launch dates and funding goals of plays, so she can decide on the best lauch date and the most optimal goal so that her play can be successful.
## Analysis and Challenges
This analysis provides the necessary information regarding the success rate of plays regarding lauch dates and goal funding target.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The analysis of outcomes based on launch date was performed using a pivot table and a line chart that deviated from such pivot table. The Pivot table was created using the the "outcomes","Parent category", "Year", and "Date created conversion" from the data set. A chart was then created that showed each month of the year,throughout past years, the launch date of theaters and how many were successful, failed, and were cancelled during that specific month.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The analysis of outcomes based o goals was performed using the countifs function in excel to count how many plays were successful, fails, or were canceled based on the range of the goal.[COUNTIFS(Data!$D:$D,">=5000",Data!$D:$D,"<10000",Data!$F:$F,"successful",Data!$P:$P,"plays")] The sum of the count of projects based on the range of the goal was calculated, which in turn led to the caculation of the percentage of the success rate by goal, by dividing the number of successful, failed, canceled projects with the total projects.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
